      <p>

        A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies
        cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely
        assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save
         you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned
         to a specific page. For example, if you personalize bolelo.org pages, or register
         with bolelo.org site or services, a cookie helps bolelo.org to recall your specific
         information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal
         information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to
         the same bolelo.org website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so
         you can easily use the bolelo.org features that you customized.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept
        cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.
        If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive
        features of the bolelo.org services or websites you visit.
